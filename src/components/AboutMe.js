  <p>
   I am a Full Stack Software developer with background in QA &#38; patent infringement analysis, past 11 years. Have a bachelors degree in electrical &#38; electronics and Most of my career, I have been working with Microsoft, different product groups. In last few years with Microsoft legal team , my job included but not limited to software development, code analysis and code reviews of huge code base to validate Microsoft patents on to competitor products. Also had experience managing  a team &#38; interacting with cross functional teams while implementing agile and water fall models. 
  </p>
  <p>During my journey I closely observed and analyzed how applications interact with operating system, kernel and hardware which encouraged me &#38; driven me towards full stack development. I am always passionate about coding &#38; development which makes me feel complete as a software developer and also as 'myself'. I would like to take my career in software development to next level in machine learning, AI &#38; IOT space where technology is growing rapidly.</p>
